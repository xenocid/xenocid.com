<li><a href="http://thosewhomake.com/">Collection of very cool videos about people who make stuff with their hands</a>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not backing up KickStarter projects very often (few are quite interesting, but too pricey), but in this case it was a slam dunk. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kaffeologie/s-filter-a-reusable-coffee-filter-for-aeropress">Kaffeologie launched a metal S-filter for the AeroPress</a>. <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/069/956/23d15ab52ab8034c29ea140aea25f2b8_large.jpg?1342331589" alt="" /> And AeroPress happens to be my favorite way of brewing coffee while I&#8217;m in the office away from other coffee-brewing toys. <a href="www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a> (who is a much bigger coffee snob than I am) also wrote a <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/04/kaffeologie-s-filter">very positive review</a>. And last, but not least those guys are local (to Seatlle) and these days the word &#8220;local&#8221; immediately adds +2 to Charisma to almost anything (at least in my book). They promise to ship it in September, so I guess I&#8217;ll try it pretty soon.</li>
<li>My friend Erik wrote <a href="http://thebucketlistsociety.com/2012/08/05/how-to-actuallyclimb-a-mountain-actually/">a long and interesting article</a> about his preparations to summit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier">Mt. Rainier</a>. This is definitely on my bucket list too and I really admire Erik&#8217;s determination in executing this dream.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.macsparky.com/">David Sparks</a> did a <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/7/3/function-key-management-with-palua-screencast.html">short screencast</a> on the little app called <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Vg6WGCcESLE&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpalua%252Fid431494195%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">Palua</a>, which allows you to switch your functional keys between, wellâ€¦, being functional keys or being keys with Apple-specific functions (like brightness or volume control etc.) In other words, if you&#8217;re using function keys a lot and you&#8217;re struggling with pressing Fn + function key (which on my Macbook Pro are respectively top and bottom rows of the keyboard), then you would love <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Vg6WGCcESLE&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpalua%252Fid431494195%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">Palua</a> . Personally, I think the best feature of the app is an ability to set the default mode for each individual app, so let&#8217;s say I want to use function keys in Vim and don&#8217;t want to press Fn each and every time, then I can make function keys mode to be default for Vim. Oh, and the best part - it&#8217;s just a buck.</li>

<li>Really glad to see that <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang">Neal Stephenson&#8217;s Clang project on Kickstarter</a> actually reached its goal of 500k, which means that it may actually happen now. I&#8217;m interested in the concept and though the fact that it&#8217;s going to be a PC game makes it less interesting for me (my gaming is now pretty much exclusively on iPad and Xbox (well, and on a Mac too)), still it&#8217;s an interesting project and I wish it well. Plus they&#8217;re here, in Seattle, which makes it infinitely cool.</li>

<p>It will take some experimentation to get up to speed with the Octopress, but I like it so far</p>

<li><a href="http://www.macsparky.com/">David Sparks</a> did a <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/7/3/function-key-management-with-palua-screencast.html">short screencast</a> on the little app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palua/id431494195?mt=12">Palua</a>, which allows you to switch your functional keys between, wellâ€¦, being functional keys or being keys with Apple-specific functions (like brightness or volume control etc.) In other words, if you're using function keys a lot and you're struggling with pressing Fn + function key (which on my Macbook Pro are respectively top and bottom rows of the keyboard), then you would love [Palua] (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palua/id431494195?mt=12). Personally, I think the best feature of the app is an ability to set the default mode for each individual app, so let's say I want to use function keys in Vim and don't want to press Fn each and every time, then I can make function keys mode to be default for Vim. Oh, and the best part - it's just a buck.

<li>Really glad to see that <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang">Neal Stephenson's Clang project on Kickstarter</a> actually reached its goal of 500k, which means that it may actually happen now. I'm interested in the concept and though the fact that it's going to be a PC game makes it less interesting for me (my gaming is now pretty much exclusively on iPad and Xbox (well, and on a Mac too)), still it's an interesting project and I wish it well. Plus they're here, in Seattle, which makes it infinitely cool.</li>

- [Collection of very cool videos about people who make stuff with their hands](http://thosewhomake.com/).
- I'm not backing up KickStarter projects very often (few are quite interesting, but too pricey), but in this case it was a slam dunk. [Kaffeologie launched a metal S-filter for the AeroPress](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kaffeologie/s-filter-a-reusable-coffee-filter-for-aeropress). ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/069/956/23d15ab52ab8034c29ea140aea25f2b8_large.jpg?1342331589) And AeroPress happens to be my favorite way of brewing coffee while I'm in the office away from other coffee-brewing toys. [Marco Arment](www.marco.org) (who is a much bigger coffee snob than I am) also wrote a [very positive review](http://www.marco.org/2012/08/04/kaffeologie-s-filter). And last, but not least those guys are local (to Seatlle) and these days the word "local" immediately adds +2 to Charisma to almost anything (at least in my book). They promise to ship it in September, so I guess I'll try it pretty soon.
- My friend Erik wrote [a long and interesting article]( http://thebucketlistsociety.com/2012/08/05/how-to-actuallyclimb-a-mountain-actually/) about his preparations to summit [Mt. Rainier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier). This is definitely on my bucket list too and I really admire Erik's determination in executing this dream.
